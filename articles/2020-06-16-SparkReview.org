** Abstract

  :END:

  A personal compact and simple review of the [[https://www.positivegrid.com/spark][Positive Grid Spark]]
  Amp. This will be more a review from my personal point of view,
  without inspecting feature by feature, but pointing out
  strengths, weaknesses and especially personal considerations.

** Content

  :END:

  The standard guitarist usually is also a gear fanatic and he's
  always in search of something new to try and experiment with, it
  can be a new amp, software, guitars, pedals...

  So you might think: /"Well this guy is also a nerd, so he should be
  the best one when it comes to gear reviews!"/. Nothing could be more
  wrong than that ðŸ˜… When it comes to the guitar I'm the most pragmatic
  person, focused on doing exercises and practice, spending no time on
  staying up to date with the latest news. Then it makes me the most
  unqualified person for the job.

  Anyway, I'll give you my honest opinion on this amp, and hopefully,
  you could find it useful. My main suggestion still, is to check out
  the Youtube reviews I linked in the [[#ArticleContentYoutubeLinks][Other Youtube Reviews links
  Section]]. I can tell you I decided to pre-order this amp in late
  2019 by looking at those first.

*** Situation, Motivation & First Impact
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ArticleContentSituationMotivationFirstImpact
  :END:

  Before starting, I want to explain my current situation, so you will
  understand also the follow-up motivations. At the moment, I'm
  working abroad, and that means: away from my hometown, on rent, with
  a fraction of what I usually have (both in terms of space available
  and gear). Plus, I wish to keep my belongings compact because I
  might need to move again and again. If you ever had to move to a
  different location you know what I mean. However, you know, you
  can't stay without playing for longer ðŸ˜›

  Then, I bought a cheap [[https://www.jacksonguitars.com/en-GB/guitars/js-series/js-series-dinky%C2%AE-arch-top-js22-7-dka-ht/2910132568.html][7-string guitar]] (because I never had one, so
  why not), a ~100$ [[https://m-audio.com/m-tracks/2x2][external audio interface]], a small [[https://www.blackstaramps.com/uk/products/fly-3][Blackstar mini
  amp]] (I got it from 6 months Metalhammer subscription ðŸ˜Ž) and a pair
  of [[https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/monitoring-headphone-studio-headphone-professional-audio-hd-380-pro][headphones]]. Using the guitar plug-ins on the PC, I was able to:
  play, record, jam along, and going back to business. In fact, I used
  this setup to record several songs you could find on my Youtube
  channel. All is well that ends well, but there's always room for
  improvement, especially in this case.

  I started to see [[https://www.positivegrid.com/spark][Positive Grid Spark]] commercials, reviews at the end
  of the last year when they started to sell it in preview. So looking
  at the specs I noticed it did exactly what all my current setup did
  and more. In particular, what attracted me was:
  + The ability to record
  + I can use it as an external speaker for my PC
  + Its 40W, it's always good to have some power ðŸ˜›
  + All the amp simulations, available also on-line. Since I'm a lazy
    person, if I can get a good tone without spending time tweaking
    this setting or the other, the better.
  + *The Price* Last, but not least! Just ~300$ ðŸ˜²

  It also comes with other features, but not very appealing to me
  honestly. You can find the details on the [[https://www.positivegrid.com/spark][amp page]].

  For all those reasons I decided to do me a Christmas gift and I
  ordered. Unfortunately, It took a long time to arrive, 6 months, due
  to the unexpected amount of orders and a little pandemic in
  between. The first impact I had was great, it does exactly what it
  claimed. I had some troubles setting it up, with the Bluetooth
  pairing between the app and the PC, for instance, I discovered it can't
  be controlled by the phone app (changing the settings) and receive
  the audio from the PC at the same time, but apart from these little
  details, I don't have any complaints about the sound.

  In the next section, I will record some licks and riffs so you can
  hear the factory presets. I will not apply any post-production
  effect or changes so you can hear the raw sound out of the unit
  itself.

  I leave you with a lesson I learned about practice amps: /In order to
  be good, it should not have the battery supply option!/

*** Demos

**** Technical Difficulties
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ArticleContentDemosTechnicalDifficulties
    :END:

     Yesterday, I tried recording something specifically for this
     review, but I encountered some technical difficulties. In
     particular, the problem was with the connectivity between the amp
     and the PC.

     Positive Grid provides a specific [[https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039598451-Installing-Windows-Driver-for-Spark-Video-Tutorial-][ASIO Driver]] for the Spark amp,
     but even if I have that installed, it seems that the USB
     connection is not reliable. It often disconnects and was
     impossible to take a recording or jam along. Meanwhile, the
     Bluetooth connection works without any problem.

     In the end, I realized that they keep updating the driver. In
     fact, going to [[https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039598451-Installing-Windows-Driver-for-Spark-Video-Tutorial-][the driver page]] right now I see /Updated:
     Yesterday/. Therefore, I just installed the new driver, restarted
     the PC and it seemed to work fine.

     In the following sections, I will expose the criteria behind the
     demos I will record. So you can hear the Spark sound.

     *Edit:* I just received right now an email telling the spark
     users to update the amp firmware to improve connectivity.

     *Edit:* <2020-06-19 Fri> What still happens is that, when you
     record using USB, the connection is quite unstable. When a
     disconnection happens, the recording stops and you need to
     unplug-plug the cable again and exit the DAW and you *MAY* solve
     the issue. Otherwise the recording will present problems
     (clipping and various noises).  I add a sample of one of the
     interferences

     #+begin_export html
     <audio controls>
       <source src="2020-06-16-SparkReview/RecordingInterference.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
       Your browser does not support the audio element.
     </audio>
     #+end_export

     It could also happen that the recording works and then degrade
     over time. As a result you will hear back the clips/noises/interferences.

**** The Demo Plan
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ArticleContentDemosTheDemoPlan
    :END:

     The main problem with doing Spark's demos is that it can
     reproduce an infinite variety of sounds you can craft by the app
     or download from the cloud. Then, I will just restrict the number
     of sounds to the factory ones (those you can select by the fist
     knob on the amp itself).

     Moving on, another decision to take is, what to play as a proper
     sample? My idea is to select 3 different licks:
     + One for testing clean tones (3)
     + One for testing crunch/blues tones (2)
     + One for testing high gain tones (2)

     Then, I also want to play the same lick with different magnet
     setup:
     + Bridge magnet
     + Neck magnet
     + Bridge and Neck magnets

     This strategy will bring at least 21 samples, but I might play a
     little more then that ðŸ˜„. I hope those will
     give you quite a clear idea of the amp.

     About the sound manipulation, I will not add any mixing/mastering
     to the files: I'll just click record, and export the results. So
     you will have the exact raw sound files.

     *Edit*: for space reason I had to convert the wav files to mp3

***** Acoustic

      This tone is probably reserved for the acustic guitar since spark
      promote himself as an amp for that as well.

** Conclusions

  :END:

  The final judgment on the amp can't be anything else then a positive
  one. For such a price, I really doubt you could find a product that
  gives you so much flexibility in terms of tones and features
  (recording, playback, connectivity..).

  I'm not saying it's perfect, since the technical issues I found while
  recording are particularly annoying. Plus I didn't had the chance to
  record a full song yet. I really hope it's just a software issue and
  that it could be resolved with future releases of the ASIO driver.

  In summary, If you are looking into a practice amp that is cheap,
  flexible and sounds great, this is definitely awesome.

  Of course, don't hesitate into give me some feedback: if you have
  the amp, what do you think about it, if you liked the article
  etc. you can find me from the links into the main page ðŸ˜‰. Also, I
  might come back here and update this article with new content in the
  future
