** Abstract
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ArticleAbstract
  :END:

  Scala is facing a crisis since some years. Someone says since Scala 3. I still love the language and I think it's great, but at some point we must face reality and adapt to it accordingly or die.

  I want to briefly add some words about it myself, maybe they will make you think about your current situation too and push you toward action.

** Content

  :END:

  I'm facing a sudden change at this point in my career: I'm unemployed.
  It happened before and it never was a big deal: as a (scala) software developer I used to be chased by recruiters, flooding me with tons of opportunities. I was expecting the same this time, but it's not the case anymore.

  There are a handful jobs opportunities, but mainly for Senior Developers. I have some experience already, so I can personally apply for those, but the fact that there are NO OPTIONS for juniors/graduate or mid developers is really worrying about the situation of the language. Plus, consider I'm based in London, so here it should be relatively easy to find positions.

  Then I came across [[https://arbuh.medium.com/why-i-am-moving-away-from-scala-7a9d3dca17b9][this article]] that summarize and touch some key points about the state of the language. I don't fully agree on everything, but some data can't be challenged, such as the decline in stack overflow survey for instance.

  I don't want to waste you much time, just wake you up and let you think about it.

*** Update <2025-10-13 Mon>

  I'm subscribed to a scala group on [[https://www.meetup.com][meetup.com]] and I just received an email. I report it here as a testimony of what I meant and the fact that this is not just a feeling of mine, but a mere fact

** Conclusions

  :CUSTOM_ID: ArticleConclusions
  :END:

  Personally, I realized I bet too much on Scala alone instead of starting developing a more wide working experience. This put me in a problematic situation and now I find myself looking to switch technology in order to feel safe again.

  I'm looking into learning Node and JavaScript/Typescript at the moment as it surely won't disappear or shrink anytime soon and you can still do some Functional Programming with it compared to Python, Go or Rust (that has some FP in it, but it's a low level language and I don't want to go down there). I'll keep learn it even if I land in a Scala job because I don't think the situation will improve, even if I hope so because Scala is a great language that doesn't deserve the oblivion.
