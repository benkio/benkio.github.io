  :END:

  Since some time now I hear about the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page][Nix package manager]]: how it is
  awesome, how it solves you all the configuration problems of this
  world, how it will make you hardware agnostic. You can read all the
  benefits of it all over the web. Then, as a software developer and a
  curious nerd with his own configuration scripts and so on, I decided that's
  time to give it a go.

  In this article, I will describe the process, from being a complete
  newbie, knowing nothing about it apart form the last paragraph, to set
  up a configuration in a weekend.

  Disclamer: you might have different needs from mine, but still I
  think this could help someone else. So, let's get ready to rumble!!!

*** The Plan

    As a real professional, I must start with a tweet ðŸ˜‰
    #+caption: The Plan Tweet
    [[file:./2021-01-29-NixMigration/The_Plan_Tweet.png]]

    I skip the ~Virtual Box~ & ~Ubuntu Minimal~ installation. I choose
    Ubuntu minimal as a base since I want to really start from scratch
    and try to setup also the window manager.

    Another question I want to answer straight away is: /Why don't I
    just start using ~NixOs~ instead?/ Honestly, I don't have a strong
    reason, I can say I want to start as minimal as possible and from a
    thing I know. Plus, it should be quicker to set up a minimal
    virtual machine rather then one with ~NixOs~.

*** First Impact

    The only word I can think of is: *overwhelming*, but not in a good
    way. It has so much stuff that you, newcomer, will feel confused
    and disoriented. You might thing Â«Oh, let's read the manual/guide
    from the official siteÂ», well there are tons of stuff: the ~Nix~
    language, the ~Nixos~, the different commands, multi-user setup,
    profiles and much much more. The only thing I found useful was
    how to install ~Nix~ and that's it.

    What I'm searching is: how to setup my own configuration, then,
    when the need arise, I will go and search how to create a Set or a
    function with the ~Nix~ language. Instead, a lot of the guides
    doesn't start from a simple plain configuration with, let's say, just
    ~wget~ and ~7zip~.

    So, I kept reading and reading, landing finally on Reddit. They
    suggest to take an existing configuration and start by modifying
    that. I must say the majority of the guides are about ~NixOs~
    instead of just ~Nix~ on a non-NixOs distribution, like I'm trying to do.

**** NixOs and Home Manager

     In the end, I discovered that, with ~Nix~ only, you can't
     actually manage the whole system(or it's not straightforward at
     least). In particular, I wasn't able to find a guide telling you
     how to set up a proper script like you would with bash. Plus,
     if you want to change some configuration apart from just
     installing/uninstalling software, you need ~NixOs~. That could be
     installed by using the [[https://github.com/jeaye/nixos-in-place][nix-in-place script]], but, what it does is
     to create an _alternative_ root folder as you will just restart
     in ~NixOs~ and moves everything you have to an ~old-root~ folder. I
     don't think you want that, unless you just do it from the start
     (and still I find it not very cool, let's say okayish).

     After some more research, I found the [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][Home Manager Package]]. This
     will extend the capabilities of ~Nix~ by far and let you manage
     your home directory using ~Nix~. I still don't know if this has the
     same power of ~NixOs~, but it seems the thing I want. Especially,
     considering that I wish to be more OS independent as possible.

     What you have to do is to create a ~home.nix~ into your
     ~$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/~ and then run ~home-manager switch~.
     Checkout my [[https://github.com/benkio/nix-config/commit/378a70906e691d4bdf3892844740743716eef40f][Initial Commit]]. If you want to check out the initial
     reference script, you can find it [[https://gist.github.com/benkio/2d4346e5e02b85556b0e][here]].

*** Setup From existing Github Configuration

    As every Emacs user, I already have my Emacs configuration
    jealously crafted and polished. Now, I don't want to restart from
    scratch and specify all the packages I have and so on. Plus, I have
    some custom ~elisp~ functions I wish to preserve. Fortunately,
    ~Nix~ gives you a way to fetch something from Github using
    ~fetchFromGitHub~ function. ([[https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-sources][Manual Section]])

    So, the idea here is to:
    + Download your configuration from Github: provide the owner, repository,
      reference to the specific commit or tag and hash SHA256 of the
      resulting directory
    + Tell ~Nix~ to copy it into the ~$HOME/.emacs.d/~ directory. I
      can't move it since ~Nix~ stores immutable directories in his
      store. Therefore, you must just make a copy to the desired
      location. Fortunately the Emacs configuration, without compilation
      packages is not that big.
    + Setup the Emacs server hook. (Optional, advanced topic)

    And that should be it. I took [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/14277][this issue]] as a reference.
    *EDIT:* After a little bit more research I found this better
    answer: [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/home-manager-spacemacs/8033][emacs.d home-manager dot file(directory)]]

    This works, BUT!!! the result will be all symlinks to the ~Nix~
    store. Then, you can't actually change anything from the
    configuration itself because ~Nix~ store immutable data. You
    should change it somewhere else, commit, recalculate the
    sha256...a full-pain. Then, you have to put a simple shell snippet
    to copy the source to the ~$HOME/.emacs.d/~ folder and change the
    permissions in order to be able to change it.

    Huge downside of using ~fetchFromGitHub~ is that it just download
    the tarball and extract it's content. Therefore, your Emacs ~.git~
    folder is not downloaded and then, when you move it to the right
    place with the shell snippet you don't have the git
    repository. Now, you can decide to use ~fetchGit~ with the
    option ~leaveDotGit = true~ to solve the issue, *but* remember
    that ~Nix~ rely on sha256 and bring the ~.git~ folder down will
    increase the probability of a mismatch!! ([[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/keep-git-folder-in-when-fetching-a-git-repo/8590/2][source]])

    As a result, you will have your beloved ~emacs.d~ configuration
    maintained in another repository. The only weirdness I noticed was
    that the resulting ~git~ repository is set on a new branch called
    ~fetchgit~. What you have to do is to:
    + Setup the remote: ~git add remote origin
      https://github.com/....~
    + Create & checkout a new branch from ~master~.
    + Delete the ~fetchgit~.

    Now the question is: does in work consistently? Is it actually
    reproducible? Future myself will tell.

    [[https://github.com/benkio/nix-config/commit/6b2a31fafab4f9853f9ef9a87acbebbfa810eab1][emacs configuration commit]]

*** Provided Packages

    I must say the amount of available packages is huge: I found
    (almost) all I needed straight out of the main channels. I had
    some trouble installing the ~amule~ package due to a missing
    library (~crypto++~) and the ~home-manager build~ became quite
    slow checking the packages, but overall it went smoothly more then
    expected.

    [[https://github.com/benkio/nix-config/commit/ef67d992efe0f96840e16814fe669ebae8c2498d][add packages and todos to the home.nix]]

*** The Unexpected

    I added more packages, I added the keyboard configuration and so
    on, then I looked into how to setup ~I3~ and ~X11~. Well, as a result
    I caused an infinite login loop, inserting ~startx~ into the
    ~.bash_profile~. Apparently it tried just to turn back to login
    again!!

    Well, I guess it's time to try to setup a new virtual machine then.

    As you could imagine, setting up ~X11~ and ~XOrg~ is not that
    straight forward as the other packages. The reason behind this is
    because online you can find a lot of articles using ~NixOs~ that
    provides a system layer, meanwhile in here I don't have that, I
    need to setup everything into the ~home-manager~ that seems to
    have a subset of the configurations you can specify in
    ~NixOs~.

    For example, in the following pages all reference to the
    ~Nix~ configurations in the /etc/ folder:

    [[http://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Installing_xmonad#NixOS][XMonad NixOs Installation Page]]
    [[https://gvolpe.com/blog/xmonad-polybar-nixos/#xmonad][Gabriel Volpe's XMonad Configuration]]

    *edit:* I start thinking that, installing ~XOrg~ into ~VirtualBox~
    is not a wonderful Idea and it might just not work. I'm thinking
    about creating a Virtual machine with a GUI in place. I know it's
    a fallback from the initial plan, but I have to reduce the amount
    of weirdness if I wish to proceed ðŸ˜ƒ

    After tons of trials, finally, I have to give up on
    setting the Window Manager. Basically, if you are using ~NixOs~ it
    should be easy: you have your own ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~
    where you set your system configuration and then, on
    ~$HOME/.config/nixos/home.nix~ you can enable thing on the user
    side easily. The problem here is that you are bound to
    ~NixOs~. You can install it with ~nix-in-place~, but in my
    mind you should be able to *CONFIGURE* everything you want without
    having to go into the specific Linux distribution.

    I might ask for help in the future into some IRC channel or wherever.

*** Developer Environment

    After the failure of the previous section I decided that I can
    live without setting my window manager for now ([[http://read.gov/aesop/005.html][The Fox & The
    Grapes]]), what about ~Scala~ and ~Haskell~ then? Well, guess what, I
    cloned a bunch of project in both languages and I wasn't able to
    compile them in the virtual machine.

    + Sbt ::
#+begin_src
MissingRequirementError: Object java.lang.object
in compiler mirror not found
#+end_src
    + Stack :: ~libgmp.10.so: cannot open shared open file~

    For both this errors I scanned the internet for HOURS without any
    success. After all this pain, I'm really considering to just have
    an additional shell script to run post-Nix. At least I can get
    what I can't set from ~Nix~...if I just don't consider the whole
    experiment a failure, but definitely it is not going the way I was
    hoping for. Especially considering that I could just
    install the ~haskell-plaftorm~ with a one-liner command.

  #+caption: Weekend Recap
  [[file:./2021-01-29-NixMigration/weekendResult.png]]

  Well, this is the final result. Not that great. What I could try to
  do is to actually use directly ~NixOs~ and get away with it, but
  who knows.

  I know you want me to answer the questions:
  - Is it hard? Yes, as every time you need to work with a new
    technology I guess. You need to learn a new language, a new way of
    dealing with software and basically google for everything hoping
    it's not a pain in the nuts...being often disappointed...
  - Do you recommend it? Mmm hard to say, I did it since I'm a nerd
    and I like to try stuff out when I hear/read good things about them,
    but it's really worth it? Isn't just better to create your docker
    image and live with it? Is actually better then a well crafted
    script? Very hard to say, but I mean: I use Emacs, I have a blog
    in org-mode. It's obvious that there is already something wrong
    here. Probably, you should consider how important is for you to
    have a really stable environment (more than bash script) and how
    frequently you have to setup a new machine as well!
  - When this could be convenient? I think, using ~Nix~ +
    ~home-manager~ without ~NixOs~, could be convenient when you don't
    care/want/can manage the operating system settings, eg. some
    developers set up their MacOs using ~Nix~ instead of ~Homebrew~.
