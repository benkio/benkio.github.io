Not some time ago I watched the mighty <a href="https://twitter.com/NicolasRinaudo">Nicolas Rinaudo</a> dealing with
the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Gilded Rose Kata</a> on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/scalalove">scalalove's twitch channel</a> and that
inspired me into trying it out using my favorite languages: Scala &amp;
Haskell.
</p>

<p>
I'll structure the article in this way:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I want to get familiar with the actual code-base, analyze it, and
explain what are the (main) flaws I can see. This section will be
language-independent, since the same algorithm will be
implemented in the same way, no matter the language, by kata's
definition. It's a refactoring kata after all.
</li>
<li>Following the previous point, I will write down the approach I'll
use. This should be language-independent as well
</li>
<li>Then, It's time to point out the difficulties I found into doing
it with Scala and Haskell, the pros and cons. I could try also to
do a comparison between the two.

<p>
In order to write this section, I just need to access the <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Github kata
repo</a> and do the most boring thing I usually do, after meetings: a
code review.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> this code is intentionally bad. If you will ever
encounter a code-base like this one in your life, listen to me&#x2026;
</p>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/A6PcmRqkyMOBy" width="480" height="224" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>
let's start&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
First thing first, I see there are no tests for the
application. That needs to be fixed ASAP. We will talk about that in
the <a href="#SolutionApproachTestsContent">specific section</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then I see an attempt of a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model">Domain Model</a></i>. That's actually a good
practice: design your types first and be as picky as possible in
order to <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/">make the illegal states unrepresentable</a>. The problems here
are
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>var</code> keyword, that means mutability. As an FP enthusiast, I
know mutable state can be hard to manage and lead to unintended
behaviors. I just notice how it's a problem with the Scala solution
only! Mutation is possible in Haskell too, but luckily we got
spared.
</li>
<li>Just Items!! There are two possible cases: the problem is
extremely simple or we are missing some types here.
</li>
<li>No validations. I expect to see some data validation to ensure the
values we are going to compute remains valid throughout the program
execution.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, it comes to the main algorithm and It has several problems as expected:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There's only one giant function. Ok, that in the end the CPU will
execute 1 operation at a time(mono-core, single-thread), but code
needs to be human-readable. <i>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</i> (Martin Fowler)
Plus it violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.
</li>
<li>Mutation again! Apart from the items fields, that was expected,
also into the index variable <code>i</code>. Luckily, it is just used to
select the current element to evaluate, it could be way worse,
like a different algorithm for odd and even elements, checks on
the index, and so on.
</li>
<li>There should be Types and a compiler somewhere, but I don't see
any usage of those in here. The code is nearly indistinguishable
from Javascript.
</li>
<li>Nested Ifs statements.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-SolutionApproachContent" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="SolutionApproachContent"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Solution Approach</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-SolutionApproachContent">
<p>
Following up on the previous analysis, we can come up with a plan, and
here I'll prioritize the tasks we need to do in order to make
this code better and solve the kata.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-SolutionApproachTestsContent" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="SolutionApproachTestsContent"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Tests</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-SolutionApproachTestsContent">
<p>
The first task needed is a good test suite. With proper testing, we
will be sure that the changes we are going to make are
correct. After all, the definition of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">Code Refactoring</a></i> is to <b>NOT</b>
change the program behavior.
</p>

<p>
Now, the test suite can be crafted using multiple techniques and it's a
huge topic by itself. In this case, testing is not the main focus of
the kata but still key. Fortunately, it's a simple, little, local
program. So we should be fine with just <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit Testing</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing">System Testing</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
Usually, testing is done by providing some specific input data to
the program, fetch the result of the computation, and then compare
it with what is expected. That's completely fine and it's what the
majority of the companies do nowadays. The downside of this approach
is it's static: let say your program has a bug, or crash, for a
corner case you didn't think about, testing by example will not
help you there.
</p>

<p>
A different approach I like more is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing">Property Testing</a>, where the
input data is <b>generated</b>. The software engineer defines the rules
used by the supporting library/framework to generate the inputs and
then the expected behavior as a property. I won't go deeper into it,
but the typical example is the associativity of the sum
operation. Definitely, the most complicated part is to identify the
properties of your program, but in my honest opinion, I still see
benefits into just take advantage of the generated inputs. For
instance, you will write your test once and it will run multiple
times with several inputs. It's straight away a big plus.
</p>

<p>
Another downside of this approach is the computational cost:
generating inputs and having multiple runs will increase the testing time.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Edit:</b></b> Since we have even the specs of the program the
property base testing fits super nicely: convert phrases like
</p>

<p>
<i>“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or
decreases in Quality</i>
</p>

<p>
becomes quite a natural process.
</p>
</div>

<h5 id="SolutionApproachSplitMonsterContent"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Split the Monster</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-SolutionApproachSplitMonsterContent">
<p>
Once we have the testing set up properly, we can start to break
stuff using the 🔨.
</p>

<p>
The Most annoying thing in the codebase is the giant
stand-alone function. I will tackle this by splitting that
function into two or more sub-functions. Then, repeat the same
approach for the outcoming functions. This recursive process
will terminate when the functions I end up with have a small
number of lines of code and one single mutation in it, simple as
that.
</p>

<p>
A little but key detail in all of this is that each function will
return a value and the parent function will be a composition of
its child.
</p>

<p>
This works well when you have 2 consecutive if-statements or an
if-else-statement:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
This might seems controversial and more complicated, but it helps
to put the computations in context. This way, you don't need to
go and look into the content of the functions, you can just skip
their implementation details and get an overall feeling of the
data-flow. Plus, you could not realize it yet, but doing so we
also put types back into play!
</p>

<p>
You might also notice I added an else to the first if, that's
because I want the wrapping function to actually return a type
and, since there wasn't an else, in that case, the result will be
the previous input. When the else branch is chosen the <code>f1</code>
function will behave as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function">Identity Function</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the very end, I want also to grab your attention on the way
this approach penetrates the nested ifs and allows us to collapse the
structure. Of course, we could also merge <code>condition1</code> and
<code>condition3</code>, and we might actually decide to do that in a later
stage, but let us suppose we will discover that the same logic of
<code>f3</code> is reused. This way we can just call <code>f3</code> since it's independent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Edit:</b> a very important aspect when comes to refactoring is KNOW
WHEN TO COMMIT. In my opinion, the right time is when all of the
following conditions hold:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Your tests are green
</li>
<li>You are not in the middle of a change (you know what to do
next)
</li>
<li>You are on stand-by, thinking about the next move (related to
point 2)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Doing like that will ensure that you commit quite often and you
can roll back to a <i>safe-state</i> without loosing too much
time. Otherwise, you might don't want to roll back because your
last commit was 2h ago.
</p>

<p>
Everything is in its own box that returns a new version of the
input 💜, However&#x2026; it still mutates and internal field!! But
because we are in this situation we can easily remove that
mutation and from the model itself and return a new copy of the
input with the requested changes.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Edit:</b></b> Reading the specification I'm not allowed to touch the
  Item class, unfortunately. Then, this step will remain
  theoretic, for Scala at least.

<p>
Finally, with this new working codebase, we should be able to see
patterns clearly and apply further optimizations. In particular,
regarding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Merging condition together
</li>
<li>Adding fields validation or other helpful functions,
</li>
<li>Adding new types.
</li>
<li>Structuring the code: moving the functions to the model companion
objects, in case of Scala, or to a separate module.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once the code is finally in good shape, we can:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>See some pattern emerge clearly and properly design the rest
of the code to expose them: moving the logic to proper new
types that communicate the intention of the code.
</li>
<li>easily add the new feature. It should be quite simple since
the new item to evaluate, require a logic that is already shared
with another item.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now that we have a plan, let's start the fun part&#x2026;let's
executed it!
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Edit:</b></b> Sometimes you need to do some refinements listed in
here even in earlier stages because doing it earlier helps you
very much then postpone the change. Anyway, my suggestion is to
refine as little as possible in the beginning, only when it's necessary.

I just tried to reproduce the counterintuitive behavior I faced
when subtyping, but when I went to <a href="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/">scastie</a>, the code behaved as

you know these kinds of things happens from time to time.

<h4 id="MainChallengesConclusion"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Main Challenges</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-MainChallengesConclusion">
<p>
The first challenge that comes into my mind is test
crafting. During this kata you really understand the importance of
having a very well done test code. Most of the time we think test
code is B-class code, but this kata shows it's not. It needs to be
very fine-tuned and precise in order to catch bugs ahead of
time. Plus, it's code you need to maintain and write daily, to
write your feature. That makes it on the same level as the
production code.
</p>

<p>
I agree it's not great fun to write such code and that's why I
suggest using the compiler as much as possible to reduce the
design space and the amount of tests you need to write to cover
your application.
</p>

<p>
A second relevant challenge is about being
disciplined. Refactoring consists of very small changes, this is
not always possible, sometimes you need to break quite some amount
of code at once, but that must be an exception to the regular
refactoring process. What can happen is that we might see multiple
applicable improvements at the same time. Therefore, we are
tempted to apply them all at once, instead, we should hold back and
do one single, small, consistent change, commit it and then move on to
the next. This requires a great self-discipline.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the last challenge is definitely <i>dependencies</i>. When you
have constraints from different libraries or legacy code that
you are not allowed to change, it makes things very difficult and
require you to put workarounds in place. That defiles the goal of
refactoring itself. This shows the importance of keeping projects
small and self-contained as much as possible, with the minimal set
of dependencies as possible.

Before diving into the differences I found between the two
technologies I need to do a little disclamer in order to give to
my follow-up words a little bit of context:What I will say is a
personal opinion after all, it's not based on facts, but on
personal experience. Therefore, it depends on: my emotions
throughout the exercise, how fluent I am on both languages and how
much I know about the problem (the order in which I solved the
kata might influenced me). Probably this disclamer should be
placed at the very start 😺.
</p>

<p>
One of the first differences I felt when dealing with tests In
Haskell was that I was pushed way more into abstracting things and
I might figure out why. In Scala, if a test fails, what I usually
do to debug it is putting a breakpoint or a <code>println</code> and see what
is the input of the test, the result an so on. Once I know what is
going on it's usually an easy fix: the generator wasn't right, the
success condition wasn't correct etc.
</p>

<p>
This approach doesn't hold in Haskell because you can't put a
simple <code>println</code> into the test, so you need to work differently
and as a result you end up with better code. The only way to inspect
your test is to use the REPL and when you get into it you want to
be able to execute exactly the bit of code you are interested in,
the minimal amount of code where the bug might hide. To achieve
this goal you need to extract the logic of your tests into small
functions and enhance the reusability as much as possible. This
should always be the case, for whatever language you are using,
but in reality we all know that programmer laziness and copy-paste
wins most of the time.
