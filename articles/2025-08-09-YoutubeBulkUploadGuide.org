In this guide I show you currently the best way to bulk upload video on YouTube on Android. Unfortunately, it has several limitations, but at the moment I couldn't find something better. It's a shame there's not a official comfortable way to do it, especially from Google.

*** Problem Description

You want to safely store and upload your videos online for free. A valuable option is to use YouTube directly. The main problem is to upload videos from your phone, especially if you come back from a long vacation and you have several of them.

*** Official Solution

The official way would be to use the YouTube Studio/YouTube app. However, it's not feasible as it allows only one upload at a time.

*** Current Best Solution

Searching online I found that, on desktop, YouTube Studio doesn't have such limitation. So we can use a phone browser (eg. Chrome, Firefox...), access [[https://studio.youtube.com/][YouTube Studio]] site in desktop mode and start your uploads through the top right button. To see the site in desktop mode you need to tick the option in your Android browser. In Firefox it looks like this:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class rounded mx-auto d-block
#+caption: Firefox desktop mode

Ideally this should be it, but there are very annoying obstacles in doing that. We will discuss them in the next section. Maybe moving the videos to the PC and then upload them from there could save you from some pain.

*** Problems

The limitation we have are:
1. You can upload 15 videos at a time. Not bad, not great. In particular if you have 100+ videos to upload
2. The upload is aborted if the phone goes in timeout/block. You have to change the settings by changing the screen timeout to 10 minutes at least, and it could still be a problem if you are going to upload big videos that takes long to upload.
3. If the browser refresh the upload is aborted. In particular after you select the videos you want to upload from your gallery and the control goes back to your browser.
4. Sometimes, after you select the data from the gallery app, it fails to go back to the browser and the upload doesn't start. You have to re-select the videos and retry again.
5. The interface is not friendly: it's easy to miss click, select the wrong option/video and risk to make a mess. Often you have to zoom in-out. In particular, if you click on a video from the listing or the upload dialog box at the bottom, another dialog opens up. It won't abort the uploads but you then have to close it.
6. You need to keep the browser in foreground, if you switch app the upload stops. So you can't really use your phone during the uploading. You might solve this by using the Android splitting view, but then it will be even more difficult to select options and not miss click
7. General limit of daily uploads. [[https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/163394510][Reference]]
8. All the uploads are in Draft. So you have to do something afterwards, but for that there's a great script I've found: [[https://github.com/Niedzwiedzw/youtube-publish-drafts][youtube-publish-draft]] you can launch thought the developer console while in the YouTube Studio content list that will take care of it.

** Conclusions

  YouTube native bulk upload sucks. Maybe there are third party solutions I don't know of that could mitigate this, but I find unbelievable that, in 2025, a multi-billion company as Google doesn't offer better tooling for his products. Especially key ones as YouTube.
