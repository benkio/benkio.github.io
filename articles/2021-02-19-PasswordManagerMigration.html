<p>
I'm a <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> user as a lot of others. It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a> who
stores your passwords in the cloud allowing you to just have to
remember one password for all. I'm happy to use this solution, until
I read recently this news:
<a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/16/lastpass-free-device-type-restriction-march-2021/">LastPass will restrict free users to only one type of device starting next month</a>
</p>

<p>
In particular you can read:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Starting on March 16, 2021, LastPass will start restricting its free service to only one device type, meaning those who sign up will be required to pick between accessing the service on their computer or their smartphone. The latter also includes LastPass access on tablets (iPads) and smartwatches. You‚Äôll pick an ‚Äúactive device type‚Äù to decide on where you‚Äôll use the service.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can see how this is a huge problem. Therefore, a lot of people are
migrating to a difference service, a little bit like the people are
moving away from Whatsapp due to the privacy policy changes or from
Google Photos due to the new limitations (luckly I found out I still
have enough space there)
</p>

<p>
In this article I will not go and do a compare of the difference
services out there (just a brief mention to motivate my choice), but I
will show you how I moved out from Lastpass to&#x2026;happy reading üòÉ
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-ArticleContent" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="ArticleContent"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Content</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ArticleContent">
<p>
In the following sections I will show you what I did for migrating
my data away from LastPass and the choises I made.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">Getting Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
The first thing is fetching your data from LastPass. Looking on
the web you can find that LastPass offer you to export all your
passwords/logins/secure notes to a <code>CSV file</code>. You can do it from
the browser extension or from the site, I choose the first option
</p>

<p><img src="./2021-02-19-PasswordManagerMigration/LastPassExtensionExport.png" class="img-responsive" alt="LastPassExtensionExport.png">
</p>
</figure>


<p>
you will get a CSV file with the following headers:
</p>
<pre class="example">
url,username,password,extra,name,grouping,fav
</pre>

<p>
Plus, in the end of the article we will have the list of the
secure notes. I will take the chance to clean up the file from the
useless data before importing it somewhere else. I just operate
directly on the CSV, if you are not use to this format, I suggest
you to just log in LastPass and check your data there before
exporting everything.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">Alternatives</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
There are a lot of good alternatives out there, so you need to
identify the right features you are looking for and then go on the
web and search for the right candidates.
</p>

<p>
<b>For me,</b> the features I'm looking for, sorted by importance, are:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Free &amp; Open Source </dt><dd>I don't want to do the migration and
then end up having the same problem in a year time or so.
</dd>
<dt> Integration &amp; Comfort </dt><dd>If I have a service, but it's hard to
access it or not easy to use, it's almost the same as have no
service.
</dd>
<dt> Easy Migration </dt><dd>If possible, I would like to have a way to
just upload a CSV and be good to go.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Looking online, simply on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers">Wikipedia</a> or online on Twitter, articles
etc, I filtered out and shrinked the selection to just 4 alteravies:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise</a> </dt><dd>This is free (Mozzilla) and integrated and
sync automatically from the Firefox account. If you live with
Firefox this is a great option, but, looking for a Chrome
extension I found this comment from the related <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise/lockwise-addon/issues/350">Github issue</a>
</dd>
</dl>


<figure>
<p><img src="./2021-02-19-PasswordManagerMigration/FirefoxLockwiseChromeExtension.png" class="img-responsive" alt="FirefoxLockwiseChromeExtension.png">
</p>
</figure>

<p>
You won't have a standalone desktop application and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mozilla.lockbox&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">android application</a>
doesn't have a very great reputation, especially looking at the
most recent reviews. It has a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file">CSV import option</a>, but you have to
work the Last pass csv in order to fullfil the requested fields:
</p>

<pre class="example">
"url","username","password","httpRealm","formActionOrigin","guid","timeCreated","timeLastUsed","timePasswordChanged"
</pre>

<p>
Basically it's not different from what other browsers offer, like
Chrome who use the Google cloud to synchronize your passwords or
Opera for instance.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> </dt><dd>This is, by far, the most pushed alternatives by
the media online and I can see why:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is open source
</li>
<li>It has:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all browser's extensions
</li>
<li>CLI and standalone application for all the operating systems
</li>
<li>mobile applications.
</li>
<li>integration from all the other main password
managers out there, LastPass included.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The only Cons is that it has a Free account and then a pricing
tiers, limiting the amount of users you can have or other features
like sharing data or SSO etc. It's true, if you are just the
typical user you probably don't care about those Business features
at all, but nobody knows if, in the future, they might do a move
like LastPass.(even if it would be a stupid move since we are
witness this migration right now)
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://lesspass.com/">LessPass</a> </dt><dd>This is also a valid open source alternative. It
also has browser estensions, mobile and CLI
applications. Plus, it generate your password by
just apply a function to your master password:
basically the password came from your master
password, the site and some encryption
algorithm. You don't have to sync anything. This is
very appealing for me since I like so much
functional programming. The cons in here is
regarding its low popularity, so: you get less
update for the application itself, just go on their
Github and look at the commit frequency, and the
import from other services is not straight forward
</dd>
<dt> <a href="https://lesspass.com/#/">pass</a> </dt><dd>This is the standard Unix tool to manage passwords and
it starts as a local tool. However, the nerds are everywhere,
so there are tons of third party tools that is based on
pass. Because of it, we get all the extensions and mobile
applications. The question is, how do you get the
synchronization? It happens using git and Github. The
downside is that you need to remember to push (the commit
happens every time you modify the password store) your
encrypted passwords. Finally, how do you import your data
from other services? Well, as I said, this is the nerd tools,
so you find the scripts parsing the different CSVs and import
them in pass. <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers/lastpass2pass.rb">Ruby LastPass to Pass import script</a>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">My Choice</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
In the beginning, I was thinking of move to Firefox Lockwise since
I use that as my primary browser, but I also collect some
work credentials as well. For the work credentials I use Chrome,
so I need something that's browser independent. Due to this, I
discarded Firefox Lockwise as an alternative
</p>

<p>
LessPass doesn't have an automatic way of importing the LastPass
data, and 1 have a lot of credentials. Plus, I'm scaried about the
low popularity of the service. Discarded
</p>

<p>
I'm left with Pass and Bitwarden. Well, if I was a normal person,
I would just go for bitwarden, despite the possibility of find
myself in a similar situation in the future. It is way better
structured, supported out of the box (without third parties
software) and the synchronization happens automatically, without
you having to go and push the data. BUT, I'm a nerd, so you know
what I'm gonna do, let's go for Pass!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">The Migration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
This operation should be quite straight forward. Following the
<a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass website</a>, we basically need to do these steps:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Download &amp; install Pass
</li>
<li>Validate the CSV modified. I modified just to clean it up. If
you have the data already in a good shape you shouldn't need
this passage.
</li>
<li>Setup the main passphrase/password to encrypt your password
store. It should create a folder in <code>$HOME/.password-store/</code>
</li>
<li>Run the <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers/lastpass2pass.rb">Ruby LastPass to Pass import script</a>
</li>
<li>Initialize the git repository
</li>
<li>Add the Github remote repository, I suggest to use a private one
even if the data would be encrypted anyway
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you choose Pass, I assume you can follow these steps, so I
won't show you here the commands and so on. Also becase the
commands can change based on the system you live in.
</p>

<p>
What I would do instead is: reporting in here if I find some
obstacles or odds/unexpected events during the process. This way
you are warned about those and you might dodge them or just change
your mind about this approach.
