<p>
As many people out there I manager my password using <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>. It
is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a> who stores your passwords in the cloud
allowing you to just have to remember one password for all. It's
not the only solution out there with this purpose, but it's
definitely the most famous. I was an happy user, until I
read recently this news: <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/16/lastpass-free-device-type-restriction-march-2021/">LastPass will restrict free users to only
one type of device starting next month</a>
</p>

<p>
In particular you can read:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Starting on March 16, 2021, LastPass will start restricting its free service to only one device type, meaning those who sign up will be required to pick between accessing the service on their computer or their smartphone. The latter also includes LastPass access on tablets (IPads) and smartwatches. You‚Äôll pick an ‚Äúactive device type‚Äù to decide on where you‚Äôll use the service.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can see how this is a huge problem. Therefore, a lot of people
are migrating to a difference service, a little bit like the people
are moving away recently from Whatsapp due to the privacy policy
changes or from Google Photos due to the new limitations (luckily I
found out I still have enough space there for some years)
</p>

<p>
In this article, I will not go and do a comparison of the different
services out there (just a brief mention to motivate my choice),
but I will show you how I moved out from Lastpass to&#x2026;happy
reading üòÉ
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ArticleContent"><a id="sec-" name="sec-"></a>Content</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ArticleContent">
<p>
In the following sections, I will focus more on the choices I made
and the motivations at the base of those choices. I think there are
way better articles explaining the steps to take in order to move
from one service to another.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">Getting Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
The first thing is fetching your data from LastPass. Looking on
the web you can find that LastPass offers you to export all your
passwords/logins/secure notes to a <code>CSV file</code>. You can do it from
the browser extension or from the site, I choose the first option
</p>


<figure>
<p><img src="./2021-02-19-PasswordManagerMigration/LastPassExtensionExport.png" class="img-responsive" alt="LastPassExtensionExport.png">
</p>
</figure>


<p>
you will get a CSV file with the following headers:
</p>
<pre class="example">
url,username,password,extra,name,grouping,fav
</pre>

<p>
Regarding the secure notes, they are encoded into the name field,
with an empty URL, username, and password. I will take the
chance to clean up the file from the useless data before importing
it somewhere else. I just operate directly on the CSV, if you are
not used to this format, I suggest you just log in to LastPass and
check your data there before exporting everything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Edit:</b> in the end, I spent a day to reorganise all the data into
folders, but that was because I never kept everything
in order. So, the blame is on me, not on the services.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">Alternatives</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
There are a lot of good alternatives out there, so you need to
identify the right features you are looking for and then go on the
web and search for the right candidates.
</p>

<p>
<b>For me,</b> the features I'm looking for, sorted by importance, are:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Free &amp; Open Source </dt><dd>I don't want to do the migration and
then end up having the same problem in a year time or so.
</dd>
<dt> Integration &amp; Comfort </dt><dd>If I have a service, but it's hard to
access it, setup, or not easy to use, it's almost the same as
having no service.
</dd>
<dt> Easy Migration </dt><dd>If possible, I would like to have a way to
just upload a CSV and be good to go.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Looking online, simply on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers">Wikipedia</a> or online on Twitter, articles,
etc, I filtered out and shrieked the selection to just 4 alternatives:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Lockwise">DEPRECATED</a>) </dt><dd>This is free (Mozilla) and integrated and
synchronise automatically from the Firefox account. If you live with
Firefox this is a great option, but looking for a Chrome
extension, I found this comment from the related <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise/lockwise-addon/issues/350">Github issue</a>
</dd>
</dl>


<figure>
<p><img src="./2021-02-19-PasswordManagerMigration/FirefoxLockwiseChromeExtension.png" class="img-responsive" alt="FirefoxLockwiseChromeExtension.png">
</p>
</figure>

<p>
You won't have a standalone desktop application and Android application
doesn't have a very great reputation, especially looking at the
most recent reviews. It has a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file">CSV import option</a>, but you have to
work the Last pass CSV in order to fulfil the requested fields:
</p>

<pre class="example">
"url","username","password","httpRealm","formActionOrigin","guid","timeCreated","timeLastUsed","timePasswordChanged"
</pre>

<p>
Basically, it's not different from what other browsers offer, like
Chrome who use the Google cloud to synchronise your passwords, or
Opera for instance.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> </dt><dd>This is, by far, the most pushed alternatives by
the media online and I can see why:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is open source
</li>
<li>It has:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all browser's extensions
</li>
<li>CLI and standalone application for all the operating systems
</li>
<li>mobile applications.
</li>
<li>integration from all the other main password managers out
there, LastPass included.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The only Cons is that it has a Free account and then <b>pricing
tiers</b>, limiting the amount of users you can have or other features
like sharing data or SSO, etc. It's true, if you are just the
typical user you probably don't care about those Business features
at all, but nobody knows if, in the future, they might do a move
like LastPass.(even if it would be a stupid one since we are
witnessing this migration right now)
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="https://lesspass.com/">LessPass</a> </dt><dd>This is also a valid open-source alternative. It
also has browser extensions, mobile, and CLI
applications. Plus, it generates your password by
just apply a function to your master password:
basically, the password came from your master
password, the site, and some encryption
algorithm. You don't have to synchronise anything. This is
very appealing for me since I like so much
functional programming. The cons in here are
regarding its low popularity, so: you get less
update for the application itself, just go on their
Github and look at the commit frequency, and the
import from other services is not straight forward
</dd>
<dt> <a href="https://lesspass.com/#/">pass</a> </dt><dd>This is the standard Unix tool to manage passwords and
it is born as a local tool. However, the nerds are everywhere,
so there are tons of third-party tools that are based on
pass. Because of it, we get all the extensions and mobile
applications. The question is, how do you get the
synchronisation? It happens using git and Github. The
downside is that you need to remember to push (the commit
happens every time you modify the password store) your
encrypted passwords. Finally, how do you import your data
from other services? Well, as I said, this is the nerd tool,
so you find the scripts parsing the different CSVs and import
them in pass. The one we might need is <a href="https://gist.github.com/sam-hansen/3bed7d382283e54e0c69eb6eac36ca57">Ruby LastPass to Pass import script</a>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">My Choice</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
In the beginning, I was thinking to move to Firefox Lockwise since
I use that as my primary browser, but I also collect some work
credentials as well. For the work credentials I use Chrome, so I
need something that's browser-independent. Plus, I wish to use it
on my mobile, so I need a good application for that, and Firefox
Lockwise doesn't seem to shine there. Due to this, I discarded
Firefox Lockwise as an alternative
</p>

<p>
LessPass doesn't have an automatic way of importing the LastPass
data, and I have a lot of credentials. Plus, I'm scared about the
low popularity of the service. Discarded
</p>

<p>
I'm left with Pass and Bitwarden. Well, if I was a normal person,
I would just go for Bitwarden, despite the possibility of finding
myself in a similar situation in the future. It is way better
structured, supported out of the box (without third parties
software) and the synchronisation happens automatically, without
you having to go and push the data. BUT, I'm a nerd, so you know
what I'm gonna do, let's go for Pass!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-">The Migration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-">
<p>
This operation should be quite straightforward. Following the
pass website (<code>https://www.passwordstore.org</code>), we basically need to do these steps:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Download &amp; install Pass
</li>
<li>Validate the CSV modified. I modified it just to clean it up. If
you have the data already in a good shape you shouldn't need
this passage.
</li>
<li>Setup the main passphrase/password to encrypt your password
store. It should create a folder in <code>$HOME/.password-store/</code>
</li>
<li>Run the <a href="https://gist.github.com/sam-hansen/3bed7d382283e54e0c69eb6eac36ca57">Ruby LastPass to Pass import script</a>
</li>
<li>Initialise the git repository
</li>
<li>Add the Github remote repository, I suggest using a private one
even if the data would be encrypted anyway
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you choose Pass, I assume you can follow these steps, so I
won't show you here the commands and so on.
</p>

<p>
What I would do instead is: reporting in here if I find some
obstacles or odds/unexpected events during the process. This way
you are warned about those and you might dodge them or just change
your mind about this approach.

<p>
What happened? Well, I looked closely at what I have to actually
do in addition to the points specified in <a href="#sec-">The Migration</a> section
and there's more:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> I have to set up a GPG key, (private &amp; public) </dt><dd>Not a big deal
after all, it's expected that you want your password store to
be encrypted, but you have to manage those keys carefully:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Move them around yourself between machines. I didn't check
what you have to do in order to have them available for
mobile.
</li>
<li><b>What happens if you lose your private GPG key? Well, you
are literally screwed</b>, no chance to recover it by some hint
or email recovery mechanism. All your passwords will be
gone. Then, what you do to mitigate this? You could replicate
your password store somewhere else with a different key, or
save the private key online, or a hint of it? (on the private
Github repository for instance) You don't want to do
that. Plus, you need to manually keep this consistent and
updated.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt> Import Procedure </dt><dd>Let say you have to setup your new machine
and compare the two alternatives, Pass and Bitwarden (I'm
also considering the amount of work I need to do to get it in
<code>NixOs</code> since I plan to move there, but it doesn't change so much):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bitwarden:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You download the app and install the browser plugins
</li>
<li>Login to your account with your master password: Done.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
No need to have a local configuration or anything.
</p>
</li>
<li>Pass:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Install pass &amp; GPG agent
</li>
<li>You need to clone the password store and place it in your
home. Notice how you might log in to Github/Bitbucket to do that,
remember, you want it in a private place.
</li>
<li>Fetch the private key and move it to the GPG home folder
</li>
<li>Import the GPG private key
</li>
<li>Install the plugins
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can see how all this process is much more tedious in terms
of steps and configurations than the previous one.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Because of those reasons, I just decided to migrate to the more
mainstream Bitwarden.

<p>
I hope this simple article could help you decide which password
manager to choose. I know you were expecting something fancier from
me rather than the actual winner, but in the end you need to
evaluate the pros and cons carefully and don't fall into biases if
you can.
</p>

<p>
What matters is to keep your passwords as safe as possible,
especially the ones that matter. I really hope this would be the
only article in this blog about password manager migration, but
I am reasonably sure this is the case.
