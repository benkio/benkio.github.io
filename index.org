167cm/5'6ft - 62 - 72 kg

Just another human animal who tries to get through life.

*** Activities and Interests

Curious about everything that exists: I might jump from mythology to physics, geopolitics, economics, etc However, my main interest remains music and tech. I have a terrible memory, mainly because it is overflowed with silly things, memes, quotes, and internet trash. The memory space is already exhausted ðŸ˜„

I spend my free time mainly playing electric guitar, doing coding challenges, carrying on personal projects, working out, and hanging out with friends.
Always looking forward to the next metal gig or festival, searching for new bands to listen to, books to read, and movies/TV series to watch. Too many things to do and nothing gets done in the end ðŸ˜„

I used to play basketball, with awful results. I always like a good hike or long walk outside as well as going to a museum. Italian, but I can't cook at all.

If you see someone chasing cats and making weird noises, it's probably me.

*** Personality

Very friendly and chill, it's hard to upset me, for that, there's already the software and you can't compete with it. Introvert, so don't expect me to be the center of the party, probably I'll stay quiet if in a group environment and listen, but I always try to add something to a conversation if possible. The louder the place, the quiet I become. Sometimes I lack empathy because I address everything as a problem to solve and I apply logic for that, forgetting about other's emotions, but I'm trying to improve on that side.

Awkward at first, mainly because I don't know you: what you like, wish, want or not, makes you happy/sad, your past, aspirations...
So I don't really know what to say. Eventually, with time, I'll fine tune and start to make ad hoc jokes or references. Exactly like a social media algorithm does. Expect me to often respond to jokes seriously: it isn't that I don't understand they are jokes, but I like to consider them real and keep the joke/conversation alive, adding something related to that.

However, I might be annoying because often redirect the conversation, focusing and diving on your problems in an attempt to solve them, but usually people wants to fly from them, especially when hanging out with friends or in their free time. I might make a lot of questions until I have every details about what you are doing, why and how. So I know this might cause stress to someone. However, I can't really speak about something without knowing it till a certain degree.

I think I am a great confident because I see every situation with impartiality, if you can stand the analytic coldness. I'll always be the devil's advocate, trying to find the most positive explanation to other's actions. So, If you expect from me to vent together against an enemy of yours, it probably won't happen ðŸ˜„

I often need to have a plan to follow if I'm going to do something, and probably a back plan as well. This applies also to normal interaction: I need to have a topic, can't go improvising unless the other person takes the lead. I Can't do a call without know what we will talk about. Everything needs to have a purpose. This connects with that initial awkwardness I was talking about. I would probably start collecting data on you at some point, like: what gifts you might like so I don't disappoint you or open topics we didn't properly finish talking about. Those rare case when I go with the flow, I'm in a controlled enviroment, where I know that making mistakes is not the end of the world.

I hate waste. I probably will keep using something broken till it's really unusable. This makes me also go for cheap stuff because spending more on something that's crafted in China anyway is a waste of money. As a result, I live on a budget even if I can afford more, but I prefer to save for the future. I will always accommodate someone else over my desire as I have incredibly low self-esteem. Moreover, I don't expect anything from others, so if I got ghosted or mistreated, I won't be particularly sad, on the opposite, I think it's the right thing to do.
