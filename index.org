Just another human animal who tries to get through life.

**** Activities and Interests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: about-me-content-activities-interests
  :END:
Curious about everything that exists: I might jump from mythology to
physics, geopolitics, economics, etc However, my main interest remains
music and tech. I have a terrible memory because it is
overflowed with silly things, memes, quotes, and internet trash. The
memory space is already exhausted ðŸ˜„

I spend my free time mainly playing electric guitar, doing coding
challenges, carrying on personal projects, working out, and hanging
out with friends. Always looking forward to the next metal gig or
festival, searching for new bands to listen to, books to read, and
movies/TV series to watch. There are too many things to do and nothing
gets done in the end ðŸ˜„

I used to play basketball, with awful results. I always like to go on
a good hike or long walk outside, as well as go to a museum. Italian,
but I can't cook at all.

I can't stand alcohol much. After a pint or two I'm already at my
limit. When tipsy or alterated, I don't even get that euphoria people
normally seek when drinking, but I just slow down. If I exceed a
threshold I go totally wasted. Not very useful and fun then.

If you see someone chasing cats and making weird noises, it's probably
me.

**** Personality

Very friendly and chill, it's hard to upset me, as I have to deal with
software every day, and you can't compete with it. I am an Introvert,
so don't expect me to be the center of the party. If I'm in a group
environment I would probably stay quiet and listen rather than get
into the spotlight, but I always try to add something to a
conversation if possible. The louder the place, the quiet I become.

I might come out as awkward at first, [[*Areas of Improvement][a thing I want to improve on]],
mainly because I didn't know you: what you like, wish, want or not,
what makes you happy/sad, your past, aspirations... So I don't know
what to say. Eventually, with time, I'll fine-tune and start to make
ad hoc jokes or references. Exactly like a social media algorithm
does. Expect me to often respond to jokes seriously: I do recognize
they are jokes, but I like to consider them real and keep the
joke/conversation alive, adding something related to that.

Often I might be annoying, intrusive, or worse, because I focus and
dive into your problems, in an attempt to solve them. This happens
also when it's not requested, as I interpret a complaint, for
instance, as a problem to be solved and analyzed. In such moments, I
think I'm being helpful because, as a friend, I feel the duty to
improve the other situation and life. However, nobody, especially
sensible people, likes to hear from someone else what their
flaws/problems are. As a result, the other person feels: bad,
criticized, inferior, and inadequate. This is one of the main reasons
for conflicts and one of the main [[*Areas of Improvement][Areas of Improvement]] for me.

Related to the previous paragraph, I might ask a lot of questions
until I have every detail about what you are doing, why, and
how. That's because, in my mind, the more I know, the better I can
help the other. Still, this can also increase or cause more stress for
the other person.

In the same way, I see my own flaws. So, even if I reached good
results, I'm always focused on what's wrong and what can be
improved. I think that's a bit to do with how my work is, always
looking for probblems to solve.

When talking I'm very spontaneous, so I don't spend much time thinking
about the effects of what I say. Add to this the fact that I never
have anxiety and I struggle to identify what causes it. As a result, I
might do or say things that make you anxious or embarrass you in
public, especially if in an altered state (eg tired).

I have very few boundaries, you can do and say pretty much everything
to me. That could be considered as a pro as I never take offense and
other can feel free on my side (see the start of the
chapter). However, I also forget about other's boundaries, even if
they tell me ðŸ˜… and I might came across as disrespectful or piss off
others without wanting to.

I'll always be the devil's advocate, trying to find the most positive
explanation for other's actions. So, If you expect me to vent
together against an enemy of yours, it probably won't happen ðŸ˜„

I often need to have a plan to follow if I'm going to do something,
and probably a back plan as well. This applies also to normal
interaction: I like to have a topic instead of improvising. I can't do
a call without knowing what we will talk about and I hate calls in
general. Everything needs to have a purpose. This connects with that
initial awkwardness I was talking about. I would probably start
collecting data on you at some point, like what gifts you might like
so I don't disappoint you or open topics we didn't properly finish
talking about. In those rare cases when I go with the flow, I'm in a
controlled environment, where I know that making mistakes is not the
end of the world.

I hate waste. I probably will keep using something broken till it's
unusable. This makes me also go for cheap stuff because
spending more on something that's crafted in China anyway is a waste
of money. As a result, I live on a budget even if I can afford more,
but I prefer to save for the future. I will always accommodate someone
else over my desire. Moreover, I
don't expect anything from others, so if I get ghosted or mistreated,
I won't be particularly sad, on the opposite, I think it's the right
thing to do.

I'm often late and terrible at time managing.

**** Emotional Side

I've never fallen in love and at this point, I don't think it's
possible as I immediately see the defects of the person I have in
front of me, so I don't have that initial idealization phase. No
butterflies in stomach. However, not all hope is lost ðŸ˜„ as I get
attached very quickly to people, unless in rare cases, and I like to
form strong bonds with them. I try to be as supportive as possible and
help my friends beyond what's usually done/healthy.

Unfortunately, I don't have space/time for everyone, so a handful of
people end up being selected as close friends, and those can ask me
whatever, and I'll do whatever it takes to be sure they are happy. Of
course, I would like to see something in return, like some appreciation
and affection, if I don't I might be sad at first (I'm not a robot
after all), but then cool down on my own.

I'm not jealous by any means and I don't understand it. I value
freedom over everything, as I want it as well, so I won't impose
constraints of any kind.

Over time I figure out that I'm attrached to people with the following
traits:

- Pervert :: Because I am
- Crazy :: These are more fun to be with
- Broken :: Probably because I feel the need to help. I feel useful
  around them.

My love languages are:

- Act of service ::
- Physical touch ::
- Making gifts ::

**** Areas of Improvement

- Emotional Intelligence :: Learn and improve in how to handle, especially others, emotions. *Not to threat them as problems to solve*
- Conversation Starter/Ice Breaker :: Learn how to start a conversation with a stranger and break initial embarassement
- Story Telling :: Get better at story telling, getting more to the point and keeping other attention high.
- Find Long Term Vision :: Try to project myself ahead and see what I want to become. Set goals, like this section really ðŸ˜„
