* How to Add a Book and Album

Add data is collected in the ~data~ folder:
- (books|albums).csv :: Are the ones I own
- wanted(Books|Albums).csv :: Are the ones I want

They have similar but different columns (eg. the one I wanted have a price indication).
To add them just insert the row of the data you want to add and then run
~org-html-export-to-html~ in: ~books.org~ or ~albums.org~
